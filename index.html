    <li>
      Find any flash game .swf file you want on archives such as
      <a href="https://github.com/selenite-cc/flasharchive">this (GitHub)</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Download the file.</li>
    <li>
      Open an online .swf player. I have created a very simple but functional one that can be accessed <a> href="https://m3tr0m0l4.github.io/flashplayer/">here</a>. 
      Alternatively, <a href="https://www.a.tools/Tool.php?Id=336">This one</a> works and is not blocked.
    </li>
    <li>
      Upload your downloaded .swf file.
    </li>
    <li>Fullscreen and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
